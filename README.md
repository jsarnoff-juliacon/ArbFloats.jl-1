#####This is for Julia v0.5.

####Appropriateness 

Preferred for extending the precision of floating point computations from 64 bits [17 digits] up to 512 bits [150 digits].  
Recommended for use where elementary or special functions are evaluated to obtain results with up to 250 digits [800 bits].

####Conceptual Background

`Transparency`: a desirable quality that may obtain in the presentation of numerical quantity. Where `transparency` exists, it may well not persist. A diminution of `transparency` increases `opacity`, and vice versa. Presentation of a floating point value either evinces `transparency` or furthers `opacity`.  With `transparent` values, 'looking at a value' is 'looking through to see the knowable value'.  With `opaque` values, 'looking at a value' is 'looking away from' that.  And it is that nonresponsive, nonparticipative engagement of cognitive attention that is the `opaqueness` underlying `opacity`. 

Presented with a `transparent` floating point value, the perceiver is become best informed.  There is no other rendition of that floating point realization which is intrinsically more informing and none which relays the value of that floating point realization more accurately -- none with fewer digits, none with more digits, none of greater magnitude, none of lesser magnitude.

An `ArbFloat` is an extended precision float architected to evince `transparency`. It informs without leading or misleading.  An `ArbFloat`, when viewed, appears as an extended precision floating point value.  When any of the exported arithmetic, elementary or special functions is applied to an `ArbFloat`, the value transforms as an extended precision floating point interval.


###About Arb

  This work is constructed atop a state-of-the-art C library for working with _midpoint ± radius_ intervals, `Arb`.   
  `Arb` is designed and written by Fredrik Johansson, who graciously allows Julia to use it under the MIT License.  
  
  The C libraries that this package accesses are some of the shared libraries that Nemo.jl requires and builds when it is installed; and I am calling them directly. Nemo is a computational environment where the most important software for number theory and related work. Julia is used to create a cohesive whole that shares a manner of use.  Fredrik Johansson, William Hart, and Tommy Hoffman have been especially helpful, taking the time to explain details of Arb as I was working on ArbFloats.  
  
######Hint
It is a useful fiction to think of `ArbFloats` as Arb values with a zero radius -- and sometimes they are.  When an `ArbFloat` has a nonzero radius, the user sees only those digits that _don`t care_:  the digits which remain after rounding the `ArbFloat` so that the radius is subsumed (as if 0.0).

ArbFloat values: Arb seen as precisely accurate floats   
   elevates transparent information over number mumble  
   each digit shown is an accurate refinement of value  

The least significant digit observable, through show(af) or with string(af),   
  is smallest transparent _(intrinsically non-misleading)_ refinement of value.
